# 📚 Technical Documentation - IT Department Website

This document lists all the creative methods, techniques, and smart implementations used in the project.

## 🔥 Dynamic & Modular Techniques

### 1. Google Drive as a Simple CMS
**Use-Case:** Syllabus PDFs, Study Materials, Circulars  
**How it Works:** 
- Public Google Drive folder contains the PDFs.
- JS dynamically fetches file links and renders them.
- Easy content update: just replace files on Drive — no need to change HTML.
- Applied in `study-materials.html`

### 2. Modular JS Component System
- `/assets/js/components/` houses:
  - `UIManager.js`: Manages UI updates dynamically
  - `StudyData.js`: JSON-like structure of semesters → subjects → modules
  - `YouTubeHandler.js`: Handles YouTube video embedding and play actions

### 3. Jekyll for Templating and Component Reusability
- `_includes/components/navbar.html`
- `_includes/components/footer.html`
- `_layouts/default.html` — Applied across all pages
- Avoids repeating code, makes pages lighter and cleaner

### 4. Dynamic Study Material Loader
- Study Material structured hierarchically (Semester → Subject → Module → Materials)
- Video cards swipeable (like YouTube), dynamically created using `StudyData.js`
- `study-materials.js` handles interactions and UI changes

### 5. Markdown-based Event System
- Future-proof `_events/` folder with `2025-ai-workshop.md`
- Planned loop to render events dynamically via Jekyll
- Makes event additions easy for non-developers

### 6. SEO, Robots, and Sitemap Ready
- `sitemap.xml` auto-generates important links
- `robots.txt` restricts unwanted crawling
- Helps search engines index the important content

### 7. Reusable CSS Component System
- `/assets/css/components/` contains:
  - `navbar.css`
  - `footer.css`
  - `hero.css`
- `/assets/css/pages/` for page-specific styles
- Ensures clean separation of design concerns

### 8. Responsive Design + Future AOS/GSAP Integration
- Pages designed mobile-first
- Ready for animations like:
  - Scroll reveal
  - Typing effects
  - Loading screens

## ✅ Additional Future Ready Techniques
- Event-driven UI manipulation
- JSON data-driven content rendering
- Scalable to Firebase or Supabase integration if needed
